**MqttViewer** is an Windows client for the [MQTT][1] protocol,
based on the [MqttDotNet][2] client library by Steven Lovegrove.
The MQTT topic structure is shown as a treeview like in a file explorer, 
so you get an quick overview on the received messages.

MqttViewer currently doesn't support subscribing to a special topic, 
but automatically subscribes to the "#" topic of the configured broker.
Support for subscriptions and other MQTT features will be added soon.
